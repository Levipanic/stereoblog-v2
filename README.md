# StereoDamage v2

StereoDamage v2 is a Go/Nuxt rewrite of the single-author personal blog at
<https://github.com/Levipanic/blog_proj>. It preserves the existing SQLite
data, local media, anonymous comments, and visual identity without carrying
over the v1 Express/vanilla-JS architecture.

Project contracts and the implementation backlog live in [`doc/`](doc/).
The local `old_repo/` directory is an ignored v1 and production-snapshot
reference; never commit its contents or modify the only production copy.

## Requirements

- Go 1.27.1 (older Go installations can use `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto`)
- Node.js 24.20.0
- npm 11.19.0
- GNU Make

## Development

```sh
npm --prefix frontend install
make dev
```

Useful checks:

```sh
make test-backend
make check-frontend
make build
```

This bootstrap intentionally contains no posts, comments, authentication, or
database implementation. Those are separate backlog tasks.
